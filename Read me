# Diffusion Model Training on Time Series Data - README

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a diffusion model trained on a time series dataset. The diffusion model is a generative model that learns a latent representation of the data through a diffusion process. The code includes the definition of the diffusion model, the training procedure, and visualization tools for the generated samples.

## 1. Package Import & Device Setting

The necessary packages are imported, and the device (CUDA) is configured for GPU usage.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 2. Dataset

A synthetic time series dataset is generated for training. The dataset consists of three time-dependent signals, and random noise is added to create a realistic scenario.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 3. Data Visualization

The generated time series data is visualized in 3D space using matplotlib. Both the original and noisy versions of the dataset are plotted for comparison.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 4. Dataloader

A custom PyTorch dataset and dataloader are implemented to handle the training data. A subset of the dataset is chosen for training.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 5. Model

The diffusion model is defined, including the configuration parameters, Gaussian Fourier projection layers, and the main neural network architecture.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 6. Training

The training loop is executed, and the model is optimized using the Adam optimizer. The training progress is displayed, and samples are visualized during the training process.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 7. Results

### Before Training

The initial state of the diffusion model is visualized by sampling from it before any training iterations.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

### During Training

The training process includes visualizing samples generated by the diffusion model at different iterations to observe the progression.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

### After Training

After completing the training, the final state of the model is visualized by generating samples.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 8. Model Saving and Loading

The trained model can be saved to disk and loaded for future use. This ensures that the trained model can be easily reused without retraining.

```python
# Code snippet here
```

## 9. Inference and Visualization

The trained model is used for inference, and samples are generated to visualize the learned latent representation.

```python
# Code snippet here
```
